# OpenDXL API Specification

#### Version 0.1 (Draft)

## Introductions

The OpenDXL API Specification is used to describe and document DXL-based APIs.
The OpenDXL API Specification is heavily inspired by the work done in the
[OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) to
describe
[REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
Where possible, schema definitions in the OpenDXL API Specification
utilize corresponding definitions in the OpenAPI Specification. For example,
the core
[Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schema-object)
from the OpenAPI Specification is used by the OpenDXL API Specification to
define the
[payload](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/dxlclient.message.html#dxlclient.message.Message.payload)
for a DXL message.

Version 0.1 of the OpenDXL API Specification utilizes
[version 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#dataTypeType)
of the OpenAPI Specification.

## Definitions

##### <a name="opendxlApiDocument"></a>OpenDXL API Document

A document (or set of documents) that defines or describes an API. An
OpenDXL API definition uses and conforms to the OpenDXL API Specification.

## Specification

### Format

The files describing the OpenDXL API in accordance with the OpenDXL API
Specification are represented as JSON objects and conform to the JSON
standards. YAML, being a superset of JSON, can be used as well to represent
an OpenDXL API document.

For example, if a field is said to have an array value, the JSON array
representation will be used:

```js
{
   "field" : [...]
}
```

While the API is described using JSON it does not impose a JSON input/output to
the API itself.

All field names in the specification are **case sensitive**.

In order to preserve the ability to round-trip between YAML and JSON formats,
YAML version [1.2](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) is RECOMMENDED along
with some additional constraints:

- Tags MUST be limited to those allowed by the
  [JSON Schema ruleset](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231).
- Keys used in YAML maps MUST be limited to a scalar string, as defined by the
  [YAML Failsafe schema ruleset](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2802346).

**Note:** While APIs may be defined by OpenDXL API documents in either YAML or
JSON format, the API request and response bodies and other content are not
required to be JSON or YAML.

### Document Structure

An OpenDXL API document MAY be made up of a single document or be divided into
multiple, connected parts at the discretion of the user. In the latter case,
`$ref` fields MUST be used in the specification to reference those parts as
follows from the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) definitions.

It is RECOMMENDED that the root OpenDXL API document be named:
`opendxlapi.json` or `opendxlapi.yaml`.

### Data Types

Primitive data types in the OpenDXL API Specification are the same as those
supported by
[OpenAPI Specification version 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#data-types).
Models are described using the
[Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schema-object)
from the OpenAPI Specification, which is a subset of JSON Schema Draft 4.

### Schema

In the following description, if a field is not explicitly **REQUIRED** or
described with a MUST or SHALL, it can be considered OPTIONAL.

#### <a name="opendxlApiObject"></a>OpenAPI Object

This is the root document object of the
[OpenDXL API document](#opendxlApiDocument).

##### Fixed Fields

Field Name | Type | Description
---|:---:|---
<a name="opendxlApiVersion"></a>opendxlApi | `string` | **REQUIRED**. This string MUST be the [semantic version number](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) of the OpenDXL API Specification version that the OpenDXL API document uses. The `opendxlApi` field SHOULD be used by tooling specifications and clients to interpret the OpenDXL API document. This is *not* related to the API [`info.version`](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#infoVersion) string.
<a name="opendxlInfo"></a>info | [Info Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#infoObject) | **REQUIRED**. Provides metadata about the API. The metadata MAY be used by tooling as required.
<a name="opendxlTags"></a>tags | [[Tag Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#tag-object)] | A list of tags used by the specification with additional metadata. Each tag name in the list MUST be unique.
<a name="opendxlExternalDocs"></a>externalDocs | [External Documentation Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#externalDocumentationObject) | Additional external documentation.
